## Dental Clinic
The functionalities that can be found in this project are:
### List
- "Our Dentists" shows each existing dentist in the database with their name and tuition.
### Create
- "Add Dentist" allows us to create a dentist once the form is completed. The information required is tuition and name. If the form is valid, once submitted it is redirected to the page where all existing dentists are listed (including the newly created one).
